# Frequency Decoder

This program will "decode" the file **text.txt** (or whatever file you store in `FILE_NAME`). The methodology assumes that file is enctypted using a simple substitution cipher. This code simply maps the ciphered letters to plain letters exactly by frequency. If the text file you are decrypting is large, this will get you pretty close, though it will probably not decipher the text exactly. Playing around with the order of the string `ACT_FREQ` can help.


This code was produced as example instructional code for MiBytes 2016 at the University of Michigan.
